    "Once we have our feature vectors built, we'll try several machine learning classification models in order to find which one performs best on our data. We will try with the following models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Baseline Classifier\n",
    "* Random Forest\n",
    "* K Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "* Multinomial Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology used to train each model is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First of all, we'll decide which hyperparameters we want to tune.\n",
    "2. Secondly, we'll define the metric we'll get when measuring the performance of a model. In this case, we'll use the **accuracy**.\n",
    "3. We'll perform a Randomized Search Cross Validation process in order to find the hyperparameter region in which we get higher values of accuracy. \n",
    "4. Once we find that region, we'll use a Grid Search Cross Validation process to exhaustively find the best combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "5. Once we obtain the best combination of hyperparameters, we'll obtain the accuracy on the training data and the test data, the classification report and the confusion matrix.\n",
    "6. Finally, we'll calculate the accuracy of a model with default hyperparameters, to see if we have achieved better results by hyperparameter tuning."
