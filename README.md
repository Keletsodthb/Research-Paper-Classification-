This project is intended to be a walkthrough on the development of a machine learning project **from end to end**. It covers the creation of a web application which allows you to upload a research paper it then shows a summary of the different topics that are discussed in the research article.

This is achieved with a **supervised machine learning classification** model that is able to predict the category of a given research article, and an **interactive web application** that shows the obtained results to the user.

The web application can be used at <>.

The project consists of the following steps:
1. [Raw DataSet]
1. [Exploratory Data Analysis]
2. [Feature Engineering]
3. [Model Training]
4. [App Creation]
