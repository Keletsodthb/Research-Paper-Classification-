# Research Paper Classification
Classification of text 

This project is intended to be a walkthrough on the development of a machine learning project **from end to end**. It covers the creation of a model which allows one to view the main research field discussed in an article.

This is achieved with a **supervised machine learning classification** model that is able to predict the category of a given research paper.

The project consists of the following steps:
1. [Raw DataSet]
1. [Exploratory Data Analysis]
2. [Feature Engineering]
3. [Model Training]

To enable the code to work, please create an empty folder called Pickles in the Feature Engineering folder, also create an empty folder called Models in in the Model Training folder.
These folders save the data produced as you run the scripts contained in the respective folders. 

I've included a brief presentation of the project, which does'nt go into too much technical detail, but rather gives an outline of the data and processes used.
