This project is intended to be a walkthrough on the development of a machine learning project **from end to end**. It covers the creation of a model which allows one to view the main research field discussed discussed in an article.

This is achieved with a **supervised machine learning classification** model that is able to predict the category of a given research article.

The project consists of the following steps:
1. [Raw DataSet]
1. [Exploratory Data Analysis]
2. [Feature Engineering]
3. [Model Training]
